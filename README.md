# AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction Model   (Clean & Green Technology SIH1292 ), Ministry of Jal Shakti
#Among Top10 projects and letter of Appreciation from Smart IndiA Hackathon team


## Inspiration
- The inspiration behind the AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction System is to address the critical issue of water scarcity in rural villages, towns, and cities.
- Access to clean and reliable groundwater sources is essential for agriculture, drinking water supply, and industrial activities.
- Traditional methods of well construction often lack precision, leading to inefficient resource utilization.
- This project seeks to leverage AI and machine learning to optimize well construction, ensuring sustainable water access for communities.

## What it does
- The AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction System is a comprehensive platform that combines data integration, machine learning models, and user-friendly interfaces to facilitate informed 
  decision-making in well construction.
- It predicts key parameters such as well suitability, depth, discharge, drilling techniques, and groundwater quality based on geological and hydrological data.
- The system aims to maximize the success rate of well construction while minimizing resource wastage and environmental impact.

##  How we built it
- Data Collection and Integration: Diverse groundwater-related data, including lithology, geophysical logs, water levels, water quality, and aquifer maps, were collected and 
  preprocessed into a unified format for analysis.

- AI Model Development: Machine learning models, including Random Forest, were trained to predict well-related parameters. Fine-tuning and model improvement were achieved through 
  continuous learning from new data and user feedback.

- User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web-based interface with map-based location selection was developed. AI model predictions are presented in a user-friendly manner, providing 
  valuable insights for well construction decisions.

- Feedback Loop and User Engagement: A structured feedback mechanism was implemented to collect user input on system predictions and usability, enabling continuous improvement.

- Data Privacy and Security: Robust data privacy and security measures were implemented to protect user information and maintain data integrity.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
- Successful integration of diverse groundwater-related datasets into a unified platform.
- Development of accurate machine learning models for predicting well parameters.
- Creation of a user-friendly interface that empowers users with valuable insights.
- Establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement based on user input.

## What we learned,including insights about the Random Forest ML model
- Through the development process, we gained insights into the importance of feature selection and data quality in training accurate machine learning models.
- Random Forest proved to be a robust model for predicting well-related parameters, providing accurate results across different data types and locations.
- We learned the significance of interpretability in AI models, enabling users to trust and understand the predictions made by the system.

## What's next for our AI-Enabled Water Well Prediction Model
- Expansion: We envision reaching every remote rural village, town, and city with the benefits of AI-optimized well construction.
- Enhanced Predictions: Continuous model refinement and the incorporation of real-time data will further improve prediction accuracy.
- Mobile Application: Developing a mobile app for on-field well construction teams to access predictions and guidance in real-time.
- Community Engagement: Collaborating with local communities and stakeholders to ensure sustainable well construction practices and water resource management.

## Challenges we ran into
- Data Integration: Harmonizing and preprocessing diverse datasets proved challenging due to variations in data quality and formats.
- Model Generalization: Ensuring that machine learning models generalize well across different geographical regions and geological conditions.
- User Adoption: Convincing users to trust AI predictions and actively participate in the feedback loop was a challenge.

## Our Goal (Mission)
- Our mission is to use AI to enhance existing technologies and practices related to well prediction locator and contruction, ensuring sustainable access to groundwater for 
  communities worldwide.
- We aim to revolutionize the well construction process, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, ultimately contributing to global water resource 
  sustainability.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
